EXAMPLE: Print messages

Commands don't have to move anything. PrintCommand writes to the console,
which is handy for seeing what your auto is doing.

On the robot: enable in Autonomous. Watch the console.

To use this example: copy this file over robot.py in the project folder
(the file next to robot_settings.py), then deploy: py -m robotpy deploy
