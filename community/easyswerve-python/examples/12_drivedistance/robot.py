EXAMPLE: Drive a distance

driveFor uses time; driveDistance uses the wheel encoders to drive an exact
distance, however fast it goes. Negative meters drives backward.

Try it in the simulator: click Autonomous. The robot stops 2 meters from
where it started.

To use this example: copy this file over robot.py in the project folder
(the file next to robot_settings.py), then run the simulator.
