EXAMPLE: Spin in place

turn=0.3 spins counterclockwise (seen from above) at 30 % speed for 3
seconds. Negative turns clockwise.

Try it in the simulator: click Autonomous.

To use this example: copy this file over robot.py in the project folder
(the file next to robot_settings.py), then run the simulator.
