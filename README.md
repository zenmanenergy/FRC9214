# FRC Team 9214 - Honking Narwhals Repository

## About the Honking Narwhals

The **Honking Narwhals** are a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team based in Norfolk, Virginia. We operate out of [757 Makerspace](http://www.757makerspace.org/) and compete annually in the FRC challenge.

**Team Website:** [honkingnarwhals.com](http://www.honkingnarwhals.com)

## Repository Overview

This repository contains code, CAD designs, and documentation for the Honking Narwhals' FRC robots across multiple seasons. Each season folder contains all the code and mechanical design files needed for that year's competition.

## Folder Structure

  - Code and CAD files for the 2023 robot
  
- **`2025/`** - 2025 FRC Season
  - Code and CAD files for the 2025 robot
  - Includes vision processing, pathfinding, and GUI experiments
  
- **`2026/`** - 2026 FRC Season (Current)
  - [See 2026 README](2026/README.md) for detailed information
  - Code experiments (V1-V6)
  - CAD designs and assemblies
