        # Assumptions:
        # - map origin is on the floor directly below the camera
        # - camera optical center is at z = 0.90 m
        # - tag center is 1.50 m in front of camera and at z = 1.10 m

        # yaw = pi so tag front faces back toward camera at the origin

      notes: "Single test tag: 1.50 m ahead of camera, 0.20 m above camera center"
